Have some thoughts you want to share about PathfinderJson, or maybe have an idea of something that could be improved? Let me know!

Do note that if it is not an actionable item (i.e. something to fix, something to add, etc.) I'll probably just leave a comment and "close" this report. I'll only keep open the reports that have something for me to do or keep track of. Also note that not all suggestions will make it in; I do have my own to-do list I'm trying to follow, and some suggestions simply may not fit in with the direction of the program.

Adding support for other systems (D&D 5e, Starfinder, etc.) is a monumental task and likely won't happen without some collaboration and planning.

Anyway, when you're ready, select all this text, delete it, and share your feedback!
