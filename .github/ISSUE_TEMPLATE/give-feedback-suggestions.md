Have some thoughts you want to share about the program, or maybe have an idea of something that could be improved? Let me know!

Do note that if it is not an actionable item (i.e. something to fix, something to add, etc.) I'll probably just leave a comment and "close" this report. I'll only keep open the reports that have something for me to do or keep track of. Also note that not all suggestions will make it in; QuickTrex is meant to be kept pretty simple, I don't want to bog the program down.

Anyway, when you're ready, select all this text, delete it, and share your feedback!
