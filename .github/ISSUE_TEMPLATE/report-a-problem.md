Greetings! I'm sorry to hear you've had an issue. ðŸ˜¢ Please tell us the following things:

- What version of Windows do you have? (go to Help > About > Platform Info, and see "OS Version")
- Are you using the x64 or x86 version? (also at Help > About > Platform Info, under "OS Architecture")
- What version of PathfinderJson do you have? (go to Help > About, and see there)
- What file were you trying to open? (please upload the file and then link it here)
- If I'm trying to recreate this problem on my computer, what steps should I take?

If your suggestion or problem has already been reported by someone else, I may "close" your issue as a duplicate, and link to the first report. Please direct your attention to that first report instead.
