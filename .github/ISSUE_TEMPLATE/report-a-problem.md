Greetings! Please tell us the following things:

- What version of Windows do you have?
- What version of QuickTrex do you have? (go to Help > About, and see there)
- What language of Windows do you use (if not English)?
- What do you do to make this issue occur?

If your suggestion or problem has already been reported by someone else, I may "close" your issue as a duplicate, and link to the first report. Please direct your attention to that first report instead.
